## Dotfiles

What's the best way to "declutter" home directory?  
Far as i know there's no way to do it without compromising your applications. Although it's possible to create a folder \(e.g .dotfiles\) where files are organized the way you like and then create symbolic links in the default directory in order to avoid breaking something.
