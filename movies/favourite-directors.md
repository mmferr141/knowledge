# Directors

These directors can create beautiful pictures in motion that are pleasurable to the eye of everyone and at the same time maintain the emotional impact and a coherent subject within the frame of the story. Almost every movie I watch from any of these mentioned mark me to the point of changing my experience with cinema and sometimes the world.

In the list below you can find my favorite directors and their best works:

* Park Chan-wook \| _Thirst, Oldboy_ and _Handmaiden_
* Paul Thomas Anderson \| _There Will Be Blood_ and _Phantom Thread_
* Bong Joon-ho \| _Parasite and Mother_
* Yorgos Lanthimos \| _The Lobster_
