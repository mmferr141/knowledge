# Habits

### About motivation

Depending mainly on motivation to change habits is depending on a resource whose scarcity varies on the mood and task performed. 

**The trick is to take easy small steps to do regardless of motivation level.**

### What's the plan?

So, what's the plan to change habits? Here we go:

1. Define your habit as **tiny**.
2. Do it after a recurrent event. E.g: After dinner. 
3. Repeat everyday. 

#### There's a trick: Chain habits

 Perform your new tiny habit after a familiar one, using the old familiar habit as a trigger.
