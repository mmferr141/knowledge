# Tracking

* \*\*\*\*[**Simplenote**](https://simplenote.com/) - A minimalistic app for taking notes. 
* \*\*\*\*[**Trello**](https://trello.com) - Perfect to keep track of almost anything utilizing the kanban paradigm. 
* \*\*\*\*[**Goodreads**](https://www.goodreads.com/) - A well-known social network for bookworms with a large database and community. 
* \*\*\*\*[**Letterboxd**](https://letterboxd.com/) - Social network for cinephiles with a diversified and passionate community. I use it to keep track of the films I watch and sometimes to find recommendations. 
* \*\*\*\*[**TrackSeries**](https://www.trackseries.tv/) - Simple service to track tv shows episodes. 
* \*\*\*\*[**MyAnimeList**](https://myanimelist.net/) ****- Although it's been a while since I saw my last anime episode, "The world's largest anime and manga database and community" needs to be on the list.
