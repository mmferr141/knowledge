# Favourite Directors

Each director has his style. When I was younger I used to find Tim Burton one of the best because of my fascination with obscure fantasy. Nowadays I think Burton is trying to maintain his popularity by exploring the same themes, creating "not so spectacular" movies like _A Nightmare Before Christmas_ or _Edward Scissorhands._ 

In the list below you can find my favorite directors and their best films:

* Park Chan-wook \| _Thirst_ and _Handmaiden_
* Paul Thomas Anderson \| _There Will Be Blood_ and _Phantom Thread_
* Bong Joon-ho \| _Parasite_
* Yorgos Lanthimos \| _The Lobster_
